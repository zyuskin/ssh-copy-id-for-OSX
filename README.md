## SSH-COPY-ID [man][man]

### NAME
`ssh-copy-id` - install your identity.pub in a remote machine's authorized_keys

### SYNOPSIS
ssh-copy-id [-i [identity_file]] [user@]machine

### DESCRIPTION

**ssh-copy-id** is a script that uses ssh to log into a remote machine (presumably using a login password, so password authentication should be enabled, unless
you've done some clever use of multiple identities)

It also changes the permissions of the remote user's home, `~/.ssh`, and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to remove group writability (which would otherwise prevent
you from logging in, if the remote `sshd` has StrictModes set in its configuration).

If the `-i` option is given then the identity file (defaults to `~/.ssh/identity.pub`) is used, regardless of whether there are any keys in your ssh-agent.
Otherwise, if this:

`ssh-add -L`

provides any output, it uses that in preference to the identity file.

If the `-i` option is used, or the ssh-add produced no output, then it uses the contents of the identity file. Once it has one or more fingerprints (by
whatever means) it uses ssh to append them to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine (creating the file, and directory, if necessary)
